## Danyang (Savannah) Gui

### ACADEMIC BACKGROUND 
- Columbia University, Master of Science in Biostatistics	(2020-2022)
- University of British Columbia, Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (2015-2020) 

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 
- Phase IV Clinical Trial for Using PEG-rhGH on Treating Childrenâ€™s Growth Hormone Deficiency 
Research Assistant, Clinical Pharmacology Research Center, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH)
1. Developed and validated a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect and measure
growth hormone in blood samples
2. Assessed pharmacokinetic parameters, processed data and framed the process validation report 
3. Assisted with the standardized sample management process 
- The Role of Mutated STAT6 in Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), McGill University
1. Conducted extensive literature review to synthesize existing research on DLBCL 
2. Attended regular research group meetings to discuss progress and gain insights for future research
3. Carried out analyses using approaches in GraphPad Prism such as linear/nonlinear regression, ROC curve, t-test, ANOVA, frequency distribution and correlation analysis to deal with data arising in the experiment
4. Obtained a working knowledge of various types of data analytics methodologies and techniques such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), CFSE labeled flow cytometry data analysis and PCA plots analysis 
- Refining the Protocol of Strand-Specific Post-Bisulfite Adapter Ligation(PBAL), University of British Columbia
1. Determined the exact positions of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) on a single strand of DNA by adopting bisulfite genomic sequencing technology 
2. Computed the optimum ratio and concentration of inosine and guanosine through running multiple assays by Agilent 
3. Collaborated with the computational biologist to verify if errors in the flag count lead to the fact contrary to the hypothesis
4. Developed an in-depth understanding of data visualization in R by preparing the presentation
